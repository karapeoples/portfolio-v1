					Giving me the skill to pinpoint syntax errors with some comfort and patience. It also helps in allowing parts of a
					whole to make a complete picture in my mind. It has taught me both how to follow directions and make my own path.

					I learned how to read, comprehend, and quickly adapt to new frameworks and tools, with an education from BloomTech (fka Lambda School) and training from GenSpark. To build on these comprehensions, I have started the path to my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. The first-step in this achievement is obtaining an AAS at Eastern Oklahoma State College in Software Development.
